Examples of ideas are using A-star search and developing a modified version of A-star search to reduce the state space by sampling the actions.  Normal data processing, such as cleaning data, or normal steps to solve a problem would not be the ideas for which you are searching as you read the paper.</p>\n",

Papers listed in Scopus will be in venues recognized by scholars and the papers you use should have at least 5 citations.
