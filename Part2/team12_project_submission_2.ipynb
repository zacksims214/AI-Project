Papers listed in Scopus will be in venues recognized by scholars and the papers you use should have at least 5 citations.

    "<p>For the second submission, each team member should give at least one reference to compare against the performance of the solution on which the team member worked.  Performance includes but is not limited to the amount of memory consumed, the order of the algorithms used, computation time, number of operations performed, experimental results on various data sets or trials, and measurements, such as precision, recall, accuracy, F-measure, and cluster purity/silouette.  Graphs, such as the ROC curve, precision/recall curve, scatter plots showing the relationship between two attributes, line charts showing model performance at various training points, and bar charts comparing approaches, may also be used.</p>\n",
