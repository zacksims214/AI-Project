They do not necessarily have tutorial instructions, but they do report on many ideas that were used in the past, the ideas used by the authors to solve the problem in the paper, and ideas for future research.  They can help you narrow down quickly promising ideas to use to solve a problem.  Examples of ideas are using A-star search and developing a modified version of A-star search to reduce the state space by sampling the actions.  Normal data processing, such as cleaning data, or normal steps to solve a problem would not be the ideas for which you are searching as you read the paper.</p>\n",
    "<p>Another thing that papers have are results that you can use to compare to your solution so you can see if your solution approach has merit.  If your solution does not do as well as solutions reported in the papers, use the papers to find ideas to improve the solution that you have.</p>\n",
    "<p>You want to look for papers listed in the Scopus database available through the <a href=\"https://ttu-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/dbsearch?vid=01TTU\">TTU Library's Website</a>, and enter \"Scopus\" into the search box.  Papers listed in Scopus will be in venues recognized by scholars and the papers you use should have at least 5 citations.  In particular, when reading the papers, look for relationships among the solution ideas, how the authors evaluated their solutions, and what promising ideas the authors think could improve their work.</p>\n",
